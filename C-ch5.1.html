            <h1>Storage Classes</h1>
            <p>Storage Classes – Each and every variable declared in C contains not only its data type but also has a
                storage class specified with it. If we do not specify the storage class of a variable, the compiler will
                assume its storage class as default i.e. automatic.</p>
            <p>The storage class of a variable tells us about (characteristics of Storage Class):</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Storage place of the variable i.e. Memory of CPU register.</li>
                <li>The initial value of the variable, if it is not specified in the program.</li>
                <li>The scope or the visibility of the variable.</li>
                <li>The lifetime of the variable i.e. how long the variable exists.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>There are four types of Storage Classes in C. All of them have the four characteristics, according to
                which they can be differentiated:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Automatic Storage Class (with Specifier <code>auto</code>)</li>
                <li>Register Storage Class (with Specifier <code>register</code>)</li>
                <li>Static Storage Class (with specifier <code>static</code>)</li>
                <li>External Storage Class (with Specifier <code>extern</code>)</li>
            </ul>

                    <td>Local or visible to the block in which the variable is declared e.g. if the variable is declared
                        in a function then it is only visible to that function.</td>
                </tr>

                        e.g. if the variable is declared in a function, it will retain its value till the control is in
                        that function.</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <p>Example: Demonstration of <code>auto</code> storage class with default value,</p>
            <pre>
                <code>
        void main()
        {
            auto int i,j =5;
            int k, l = 10;
            printf("\n value of i = %d \n value of j = %d", i,j);
            printf("\n value of k = %d \n value of l = %d", k,l);
        }
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>Output:</p>
            <pre>
        value of i = 2009
        value of j = 5
        value of k = 1005
        value of l = 10
            </pre>
            <p>The default storage class is <code>auto</code>. So whether or not it is defined it will work the same.
            </p>
            <p>The value of <code>i</code> and <code>k</code> are garbage values (unpredictable values) because they are
                not defined in the program.</p>
            <p>Example: Demonstration of scope or visibility and lifetime of <code>auto</code> storage class.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>As its scope is local to the block in which it is defined so block 1 will print 15, block 2 will
                    print 10 and block 3 will print 5.</li>
                <li>These three variables <code>x</code> are treated as different for three blocks.</li>
                <li>The life of <code>x</code> will persist as its value 15 in block 1 and then it expires.</li>
                <li>After that another <code>x</code> whose value is 10 will persist in block 2 and then expires.</li>

                </tr>
            </table>
            <ul>
                <li>A variable is nothing but a memory location in the main memory of the computer and the CPU has to
                    access the main memory to manipulate the variables.</li>
                <li>This activity slows down the execution of the program because main memory is about 10 times slower
                    than the CPU.</li>
                <li>Since a number of registers are available in the CPU itself and all of them are not used all the
                    time, a few of them can be used to store some frequently used variables so that execution becomes
                    faster.</li>
                <li>C allows some variables to be declared as register variables. However, it is limited in numbers and
                    varies from compiler to compiler.</li>
                <li>The keyword <code>register</code> can be prefixed to an ordinary variable to declare it as a
                    register variable.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>e.g. - <code>register int i;</code></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Normally registers are of 16-bit size so we can not use register with <code>float</code>,
                    <code>double</code>, array or structure. But if we use them as a register, the compiler will
                    automatically convert them into automatic.</li>
                <li>We use frequently used variables e.g. loop counters as a register storage class because the speed of
                    the program increases by using a variable as a register storage class.</li>
            </ul>
            <pre>
                <code>
        void main()
        {
            register int i;
            for (i = 1; i < 100; i++)

                        it retains its present value.</td>

            <h2>Which Storage Class to use When ???</h2>
            <p>The programmer can decide on his/her own which storage class has to be used and when, according to the
                requirements in a program.</p>
            <p>He can use the appropriate Storage Class by following the views for usage of different storage classes in
                different situations:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Economize the memory space requirements consumed by the variables.</li>
                <li>Improve the speed of execution of the program.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The various rules that govern which storage class to use and when are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Use register Storage Classes for only those variables which are being used very often e.g. loop
                    counter variable.</li>
                <li>Use static Storage Classes only if you want the value of the variables to persist between various
                    function calls.</li>
                <li>Use extern Storage Classes for only those variables which are being used by almost all the functions
                    present in the program.</li>
                <li>In all other cases, use auto type of storage class.</li>
            </ul>
