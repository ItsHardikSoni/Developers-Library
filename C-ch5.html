        <h1 class="chname">Chapter.5 - Scope Rules of Variables</h1>
        <section>
            <h1>Scope Rules of Variables</h1>
            <p>Scope Rules – The range of the code in a program over which a variable has meaning is called the scope of the variable. In simple terms, the scope of a variable determines how it can be accessed by different parts of the program.</p>
            <p>There are three types of scope normally in C:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Local Scope</li>
                <li>Function Scope</li>
                <li>File Scope and Global Scope</li>
            </ul>
        <section>    <h2>Types of Scope Rules</h2>
            <p>Here we define all the types of Scope Rules:</p>
        </section>
        <section>Local Scope</h3>
            <p>A block of statements in C is surrounded by curly braces, i.e., <code>{</code> and <code>}</code>. We can declare variables inside the block; such variables, called local variables, can be referenced only within the body of the block.</p>
            <p>When the control reaches the open braces, these variables come into existence and get destroyed as soon as the control leaves the block through the closing brace.</p>
            <p>So the local variables are available to all the blocks enclosed by the block in which they have been declared.</p>
            <pre>
        while (flag) {
            int x;
            if (i > x) {
                int j;
                // -
            }
        }
            </pre>
            <ul>
                <li>The scope of <code>x</code> is the while block, and <code>j</code> is the if block.</li>
                <li>The variable <code>x</code> can also be referenced in the if block because this block is completely enclosed in the while block.</li>
                <li>On the other hand, the scope of <code>j</code> is only the if block. Since a function is a block in itself, all the variables declared in it have local scope.</li>
                <li>The formal parameters in a function have local scope.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>    <h3>Function Scope</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The function scope pertains to the labels declared in a function in the sense that a label can be used anywhere in the function in which it is declared.</li>
                <li>Thus, we can use different labels with the same names in different functions.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>    <h3>File Scope or Global Scope</h3>
            <p>Since the global variables are declared outside all blocks and functions, they are available to all the blocks and functions.</p>
            <p>Thus, the scope of a global variable is the entire program file. This type of scope is known as file scope.</p>
            <p>e.g. global variables <code>rate</code> and <code>qty</code> in the following have file scope:</p>
            <pre>
        int qty, rate;
        void main() {
            int gross, net;
            // -
        }
        
        void fun() {
            char c;
            // -
            { 
                int a;
                // -
            }
        }
            </pre>
        </section>
        <section>    <h2>Scope Rules Summary</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>A local variable can be accessed only within the block in which it is declared. The local variable declared in a function exists only during the execution of the function. Therefore, these variables are also known as automatic because they are automatically created and destroyed.</li>
                <li>The scope of formal parameters is local to the function in which they are defined.</li>
                <li>Since the global variables are not declared in a particular function, they are available to all the functions. Thus, the scope of a global variable is the entire program.</li>
            </ul>
