        <section>
            <h1>Introduction - C Language</h1>
            <p>C is the Basics of all Programming Languages. Before the introduction of C Language we had only Machine
                Level Languages. C is just like any other communication language and may be even more fascinating.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <p>C is general Purpose Programming Language developed at Bell Laboratories of USA in 1972 by Dennis
                Ritchie.</p>
            <p>It has been closely associated with the UNIX operating system for which it was developed since the system
                and most of the programs that run it are written in C. Operating systems, C compiler and all UNIX
                application programs are written in C Language.</p>
            <p>It is also called a procedure oriented programming language. The C Language is reliable, simple and easy
                to use. C has been coded in assembly Language.</p>
            <p>C is structured programming language. Its instruction consist of terms that resemble algebraic
                expression, augmented by certain English keywords such as if, else, for, do and while. In this respect
                it resembles high level structured programming languages such as Pascal and FORTRAN.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Where C Stands ???</h2>
            <p>To see where C Stands, we must compare it with other programming languages which are mainly divided into
                categories:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>High Level Language or Problem Oriented Languages</strong> - The Languages which are
                    designed to give better programming efficiency that also means faster program development. Example:
                    BASIC, FORTRAN, COBOL etc.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Low Level Language or Machine Oriented Language</strong> - The languages which are designed
                    to give better machine efficiency which also means faster program execution. Example: Assembly
                    Language, Machine Language.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>The C Language stands between these two categories.</p>
            <p>Because it was designed for both i.e. relatively good programming efficiency as compared to low level
                language and relatively good machine efficiency as compared to high level language.</p>
            <p>Therefore C Language is also called as Middle Level Language.</p>
